Hi group,
 I had to change my ONID password yesterday because the system required it. I forgot what password I used so I have to
 wait until tomorrow to call the IT support number to reset my password since I also do not have my OSU ID number saved outside my OSU email. 
 
 Sorry about that. I'm going to search through my prior OSU files to see if I have my OSU ID so I can reset my password and gain access to
 our slack channel, etc.
