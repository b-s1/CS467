This folder contains a few small shell scripts to print out instructions for entering and exiting the virutal environment, 
as well as how to start and stop a flask app.

Feel free to run the programs:

   howToVENV
   howToFlask

to see how to run these programs immediately

the activate symlink in this directory exists to shorten the path to venv/bin/activate
